# Iot-based-Smart-water-quality-monitoring-system
 Developed an IoT-based water quality system  with Arduino, ESP32, and sensors (TDS, turbidity, pH, and flow) to monitor water quality, automate  safety measures, and provide real-time alerts.
The Smart Water Quality Monitoring System using IoT is an innovative solution designed to ensure real-time monitoring and safety of water quality. Utilizing an Arduino Uno microcontroller and an ESP32 for IoT connectivity, the system integrates with the Firebase platform for efficient data management. Equipped with sensors to measure Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), turbidity, pH levels, and water flow rate, the system continuously analyzes critical water parameters. A self-designed circuit provides a stable 5V power supply, while an LCD display with I2C showcases real-time readings. When water quality exceeds predefined safety thresholds, alerts are instantly displayed on the LCD and sent via a Telegram bot. Additionally, a relay-controlled solenoid valve automatically shuts off the water supply to prevent unsafe usage. If all parameters are within safe limits, the system indicates "Safe to drink," maintaining normal water flow. By combining IoT technology with automation, this system offers a reliable and efficient approach to water quality monitoring and safety assurance.
